# Introduction {#program}

In this part of the book, you will learn how to perform parametric simulation
analyses. The main focuses are on showcasing the capabilities of (1) creating
parametric models by applying measures (Chapter \@ref(measures)) and (2) easing
the comparative analysis by reusing code snippets developed in data exploration
process (Chapter \@ref(parametric)).
