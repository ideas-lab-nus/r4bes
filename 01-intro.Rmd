# (PART) R Basics {-}

# Introduction {#r-basics}

This part of the book is intended to provide a sufficient introduction to R to get you started on the subsequent parts of this book. For a more comprehensive treatment on the subject, I would recommend [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund [@wickham_r_2016]. The [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org) by Winston Chang [@chang_r_2018] is also a useful reference that provides recipes that allows you to quickly generate plots in R using the ggplot2 package.
